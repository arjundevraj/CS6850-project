#### Cost Optimization for Satellite-Earth Observation

#### Introduction

The goal of this project is to optimize the cost of satellite-earth observation. We utilize a network to represent the various satellites that can be used to observe regions on Earth at any given time. The costs vary depending on the satellites available, the regions being monitored as well as the resolution required. The objective is to provide the most cost-effective solution to monitor the regions of interest consistently through time.
